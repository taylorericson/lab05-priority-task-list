## CSC 240 - Lab 5 Priority Task List

A project completed as part of the class CSC 240 at Parkland College.

Directions: 
-
Design a Java interface named Priority that includes two abstract methods named setPriority and getPriority. Classes that implement this interface use these methods to establish a numeric value (between 1 and 5) that represents priority. Design a class named Task that implements this Priority interface to establish priority among a set of Task objects. Your Task class should store a String to represent the task and an integer representing the priority. Write a driver named TaskList that creates and prints a number of Task objects each with different priorities. Example output of such a list is shown below.

**Example program output**
